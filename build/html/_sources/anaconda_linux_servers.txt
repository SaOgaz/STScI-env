Installing Anaconda On Linux Servers
####################################

You will probably want to access Anaconda from your account on the STScI Linux servers.  If you are working on a Linux machine, congratulations this is already done!  When you setup Anaconda in your ``/user/username`` directory and setup your ``bash`` files, this will get propagated to any other Linux servers.  If you are on a mac machine, you can follow the Linux part of this instruction manual in an ``ssh`` session on any of the STScI Linux servers.
